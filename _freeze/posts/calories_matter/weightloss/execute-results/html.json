The weight loss market in the U.S. is valued at $72.6 billion[^1], and as a result, it's no surprise that many scammers infiltrate this space in an attempt to make a quick buck off of other people's misery.\n\nUndoubtedly, losing weight is a complicated endeavor and many people struggle with it, especially in light of the recent pandemic. It can be hard to separate the truth from the lies and the genuine products from the frauds. In this blog post, I'll present a mechanism to filter out 99% of the frauds immediately.\n\n\n\n[^1]: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-weight-loss-market-2022-115900788.html)\n\n# Myth: Calories do not matter. \n\nForget about all emotions, all real-life stress. Imagine a biological human robot. It is trivial to make this imaginary human lose weight. There is no woo-woo magic needed. If this robot stops eating it will automatically lose weight until it dies. Mathematically, this is the easiest way to lose weight. Some people try this method but fortunately get stopped by their hunger.\n\nWe define energy balance at time $t$ as follows:\n$$b^t = c^t_{in} - c^t_{out}$$\n\n## We constantly use energy \nOur body constantly uses energy, even when we sleep or do nothing.\nTo get an approximation for your daily energy needs you can use the following formula[^2]: \n$$ \\sum_{1 \\leq t \\leq 24} c^t_{out} = \\begin{cases}\n 10 \\cdot \\text{ weight (kg)} + 6.25 \\cdot \\text{ height (cm)} - 5 \\cdot \\text{ age (y)}  \\text{ for men}\\\\ \n10 \\cdot \\text{ weight (kg)} + 6.25 \\cdot \\text{ height (cm)} - 5 \\cdot \\text{ age (y)} - 161 \\text{ for females}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n[^2]: [Mifflin MD, St Jeor ST, Hill LA, Scott BJ, Daugherty SA, Koh YO. A new predictive equation for resting energy expenditure in healthy individuals. Am J Clin Nutr. 1990 Feb;51(2):241-7. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/51.2.241. PMID: 2305711.](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/51.2.241)\n\nNote that, obviously, if you do exercise at time $t$ you will use more energy at this time and that the formula might not be accurate for you. On a usual day, this formula is off by ~350 calories for me.\n\nIn our example we set $c^t_{in}$ to zero for all $t$ and because our energy expenditure as humans $c^t_{out}$ is always greater than zero we have a negative balance and we lose weight over time.\n\n## Food is transformed to energy \nNo matter what you eat, the body is a complex mechanism transforming everything we eat into energy (kcal).\nIf you eat something at time $t$, $c^t_{in}$, will be positive. \nFor example, If you eat an apple (~80kcal) at 1pm then $c^{13}_{in} = 80$.\n\nHow much you eat **over time** is the single most important factor when considering weightloss for our human robot. In the following picture we see the energy intake for \n(1) a human eating three meals and (2) a human fasting until the end of the day. They both do exercise at 4pm and end up in at the same energy balance at the end of the day maintaining their weight. There is no evidence that fasting brought any advantage in terms of energy balance.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\n    \n    {\n    '3_meals' : [0] * 7 + [700] + 5*[0] + [1000] + [0] * 5 + [1000] + 4*[0],\n     'fasting' : [0] * 19 + [2700] + [0] * 4,\n     'c_out' : [70] * 15  + [1050] + [75] * 8,\n    }\n).assign(**{\n    '3_meals_cum' : lambda x: x['3_meals'].cumsum(),\n    'fasting_cum' : lambda x: x['fasting'].cumsum(),\n    'energy_expended (day level)': lambda x: x['c_out'].cumsum()\n})\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nsns.lineplot(data=df[['3_meals_cum', 'fasting_cum',\n             'energy_expended (day level)']], ax=ax)\nxticks = list(range(0, len(df)))\n\nax.set_ylabel(\"KCal\")\nax.set_xticks(xticks)\nax.set_xticklabels(xticks, rotation=90)\nax.set_xlabel(\"Hours\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](weightloss_files/figure-html/cell-2-output-1.png){width=602 height=426}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Consequences\n![the brofallacy](iq.jpg)\n\n**Any diet, food claim with the aim of losing weight which does create a negative energy balance is a fraud and should be rejected without further consideration.**\n\nLosing weight is not easy in real life circumstances: After doing the obvious things to consume less calories like changing soda to diet soda/drinking water and eating healthy to eat less there is only one\noption left: *diet*.
