In today's fast-paced world, everyone is looking for a quick fix to their weight problems. The weight loss market in the U.S. is valued at $72.6 billion[^1], and as a result, it's no surprise that many scammers infiltrate this space in an attempt to make a quick buck off of other people's misery.

Undoubtedly, losing weight is a complicated endeavor and many people struggle with it, especially in light of the recent pandemic. It can be hard to separate the truth from the lies and the genuine products from the frauds. In this blog post, I'll present a mechanism to filter out 99% of the frauds immediately.

# Myth: Calories do not matter. 

Forget about all emotions, all real-life stress. Imagine a biological human robot. It is trivial to make this imaginary human lose weight. There is no woo-woo magic needed. If this robot stops eating it will automatically lose weight until it dies. Mathematically, this is the easiest way to lose weight. Some people try this method but fortunately get stopped by their hunger.

We define energy balance at time $t$ as follows:
$$b^t = c^t_{in} - c^t_{out}$$

## We constantly use energy 
Our body constantly uses energy, even when we sleep or do nothing.
To get an approximation for your daily energy needs you can use the following formula[^2]: 
$$ \sum_{1 \leq t \leq 24} c^t_{out} = \begin{cases}
 10 \cdot \text{ weight (kg)} + 6.25 \cdot \text{ height (cm)} - 5 \cdot \text{ age (y)}  \text{ for men}\\ 
10 \cdot \text{ weight (kg)} + 6.25 \cdot \text{ height (cm)} - 5 \cdot \text{ age (y)} - 161 \text{ for females}
\end{cases}
$$

Note that, obviously, if you do exercise at time $t$ you will use more energy at this time and that the formula might not be accurate for you. On a usual day, this formula is off by ~350 calories for me.

In our example we set $c^t_{in}$ to zero for all $t$ and because our energy expenditure as humans $c^t_{out}$ is always greater than zero we have a negative balance and we lose weight over time.

## Food is transformed to energy 
No matter what you eat, the body is a complex mechanism transforming everything we eat into energy (kcal).
If you eat something at time $t$, $c^t_{in}$, will be positive. 
For example, If you eat an apple (~80kcal) at 1pm then $c^{13}_{in} = 80$.

How much you eat **over time** is the single most important factor when considering weightloss for our human robot. In the following picture we see the energy intake for 
(1) a human eating three meals and (2) a human fasting until the end of the day. They both do exercise at 4pm and end up in at the same energy balance at the end of the day maintaining their weight. There is no evidence that fasting brought any advantage in terms of energy balance.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
df = pd.DataFrame(
    
    {
    '3_meals' : [0] * 7 + [700] + 5*[0] + [1000] + [0] * 5 + [1000] + 4*[0],
     'fasting' : [0] * 19 + [2700] + [0] * 4,
     'c_out' : [70] * 15  + [1050] + [75] * 8,
    }
).assign(**{
    '3_meals_cum' : lambda x: x['3_meals'].cumsum(),
    'fasting_cum' : lambda x: x['fasting'].cumsum(),
    'energy_expended (day level)': lambda x: x['c_out'].cumsum()
})

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.lineplot(data=df[['3_meals_cum', 'fasting_cum',
             'energy_expended (day level)']], ax=ax)
xticks = list(range(0, len(df)))

ax.set_ylabel("KCal")
ax.set_xticks(xticks)
ax.set_xticklabels(xticks, rotation=90)
ax.set_xlabel("Hours")
plt.show()
```

## Consequences
![the brofallacy](iq.jpg)

**Any diet, food claim with the aim of losing weight which does *not* create a negative energy balance is a fraud and should be rejected without further consideration.**

Losing weight is not easy in real life circumstances: After doing the obvious things to consume less calories like changing soda to diet soda/drinking water and eating healthy  is only one
option left  -- *diet*. Designing diets in practice is an art and out of scope for this post.
