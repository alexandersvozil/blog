    "text": "As an applied scientist for Amazon in the field of surface transportation, I am part of a dedicated team that specializes in the development of mathematical models for scheduling truck operations. Our objective is to optimize the utilization of transportation resources to ensure the timely and efficient delivery of goods. Our models are implemented in practice to make data-driven decisions that save money for the company.\nBefore working for Amazon I worked on model checking and reactive synthesis for a variety of models, including state-transition graphs, Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and game graphs. My work focused on verifying and constructing correct reactive systems using a range of ω-regular objectives, including reachability, Büchi, bounded Büchi, Streett, and parity objectives. I also utilized fast graph algorithms and modern algorithmic techniques to improve the efficiency of my work. During my research, I published 7 papers in top computer science conferences and received a grade of “with distinction” for my PhD dissertation, which was nominated for the Award of Excellence from the Austrian government and the GI dissertation prize. My full publication record can be found at https://dblp.org/pid/202/2327.html.\n\nPlease note that the opinions expressed in this blog post are my own and do not reflect the views of Amazon. I am an independent individual with my own thoughts and ideas, and my views do not represent those of my employer or any other organization."

    "text": "In today’s fast-paced world, everyone is looking for a quick fix to their weight problems. The weight loss market in the U.S. is valued at $72.6 billion1, and as a result, it’s no surprise that many scammers infiltrated this space in an attempt to make a quick buck off of other people’s misery.\nUndoubtedly, losing weight is a complicated endeavor and many people struggle with it, especially in light of the recent pandemic. It can be hard to separate the truth from the lies and the genuine products from the frauds. In this blog post, I’ll be sharing my personal experiences and providing a mechanism to filter out the frauds immediately.\nPlease note that the information in this post is based on my personal interest and experience in the topic and should be taken at your own risk. I’ve researched nutrition for building muscle to get stronger and then later on to lose fat to run faster for more than 10 years, and I want to share what I’ve learned along the way."

To get an approximation for your daily energy needs you can use the following formula2: \\[ \\sum_{1 \\leq t \\leq 24} c^t_{out} = \\begin{cases}\n10 \\cdot \\text{ weight (kg)} + 6.25 \\cdot \\text{ height (cm)} - 5 \\cdot \\text{ age (y)}  \\text{ for men}\\\\\n10 \\cdot \\text{ weight (kg)} + 6.25 \\cdot \\text{ height (cm)} - 5 \\cdot \\text{ age (y)} - 161 \\text{ for females}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nNote that, obviously, if you do exercise at time \\(t\\) you will use more energy at this time and that the formula might not be accurate for you. On a usual day, this formula is off by ~350 calories for me.\nIn our example we set \\(c^t_{in}\\) to zero for all \\(t\\) and because our energy expenditure as humans \\(c^t_{out}\\) is always greater than zero we have a negative balance and we lose weight over time."
